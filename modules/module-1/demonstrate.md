## Project

> For this project we require to use JS/Typescript and ExpressJS, a basic boilerplate is provided for you [here](https://github.com/full-stack-masterclass/fsm-projects-W2024). Please read [this](../../how-to-submit.md) before using it.
> For simplicity you can use in-memory / file based database

- **Objective:** Develop an API for managing Bennett bookstore. This API should allow users to perform basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for books, managing inventory, and processing orders. The focus is on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. 
- **User stories:**
  - As a staff member, I want to add new books to the inventory so that I can expand my collection.
  - As a staff member, I want to update the price and quantity of books so that the inventory reflects current stock levels and pricing.
  - As a customer, I wish to search for books by title, author, or ISBN so that I can find specific books quickly.
  - As a staff member, I need to view the entire inventory to assess the current stock of books.
  - As a staff member, I need to create and process orders to manage customer purchases effectively.
  - As a staff member, I want to add or remove books from an order to accommodate customer requests at the point of sale.
- **Technologies:** API, REST, HTTP
- **Deliverable:** API Runtime, Open API Documentation
- **Submit the project:** Read [this](../../how-to-submit.md)
