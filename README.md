## Project

> In the heart of a quaint town, Mr. Alfred Bennett, owner of the beloved Bennett's Bibliothèque, faced a dilemma. The digital era was changing how people read and shopped, and his cherished bookstore was feeling the impact. Determined to preserve his sanctuary of stories while embracing modernity, Mr. Bennett, with the help of his tech-savvy niece Lily, embarked on a transformative journey. Together, they digitized his extensive collection, creating an enchanting online presence that mirrored the bookstore's classic charm. The successful fusion of traditional values and digital innovation not only revitalized his business but also extended the reach of Bennett's Bibliothèque to book lovers far and wide, ensuring the legacy of his passion for books thrived in the new digital age

#### Project
- **Objective:** Develop an API for managing Bennett bookstore. This API should allow users to perform basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for books, managing inventory, and processing orders. The focus is on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. 
- **User stories:**
  - As a bookstore owner, I want to add new books to the inventory so that I can expand my collection.
  - As a bookstore manager, I need to remove outdated or sold-out books from the inventory to keep the database updated.
  - As a staff member, I want to update the price and quantity of books so that the inventory reflects current stock levels and pricing.
  - As a customer, I wish to search for books by title, author, or ISBN so that I can find specific books quickly.
  - As the store manager, I need to view the entire inventory to assess the current stock of books.
  - As an inventory manager, I want to receive alerts when a book's stock is low so that I can reorder before it runs out.
  - As a sales assistant, I need to create and process orders to manage customer purchases effectively.
  - As a cashier, I want to add or remove books from an order to accommodate customer requests at the point of sale.
  - As a store owner, I wish to generate sales reports to analyze the business's financial performance.
  - As a marketing manager, I want to know the best-selling books to plan marketing and stocking strategies.
  - As a new employee, I need clear instructions and help commands to learn how to use the CLI tool effectively.
  - As a system administrator, I want the data to be saved securely so that we don't lose inventory and sales information.
  - As a store manager, I would like to have a login system to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data
- **Technologies:** API, REST, HTTP, NodeJS, JS/Typescript
- **Deliverable:** API, Open API Documentation
