#### Module 1: Basic HTML/CSS Website
- **Objective:** Create a simple, static website for an online bookstore.
- **Features:**
  - Home page with a list of featured books.
  - About page with information about the bookstore.
  - Contact page with a simple contact form.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (optionally Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling).

#### Module 2: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript
- **Objective:** Enhance the website with interactive features.
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic search functionality for books.
  - User reviews and ratings for each book.
  - A shopping cart where users can add and remove books.
- **Technologies:** Vanilla JavaScript or a frontend framework like React or Vue.js.

#### Phase 3: Introducing Backend and Database
- **Objective:** Convert the static site into a dynamic application with a backend.
- **Features:**
  - User account creation and authentication.
  - Persistent storage of books, reviews, and user data.
  - Dynamic rendering of book data from the database.
- **Technologies:** Node.js with Express, MongoDB or PostgreSQL, JWT for authentication.

#### Phase 4: Building a RESTful API
- **Objective:** Create a RESTful API for handling bookstore data.
- **Features:**
  - API endpoints for books, users, reviews, and shopping cart operations.
  - Secure endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.
  - Implement API rate limiting and caching.
- **Technologies:** Node.js, Express, REST principles, possibly a caching system like Redis.

#### Phase 5: Microservices Architecture
- **Objective:** Break down the application into microservices.
- **Microservices:**
  - **User Service:** Manages user accounts and authentication.
  - **Book Service:** Handles book-related operations.
  - **Order Service:** Manages shopping cart and order processing.
  - **Review Service:** Handles book reviews and ratings.
- **Technologies:** Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, RabbitMQ or Kafka for inter-service communication.

#### Phase 6: Advanced Features and Scaling
- **Objective:** Add advanced features and prepare for scaling.
- **Features:**
  - Recommendation engine based on user behavior.
  - Advanced analytics for tracking book sales and user engagement.
  - Implementing CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Technologies:** Machine Learning algorithms for recommendations, ELK stack for analytics, Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

#### Phase 7: Deployment and Monitoring
- **Objective:** Deploy the application and set up monitoring.
- **Features:**
  - Deploy the microservices to a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
  - Set up monitoring and logging for performance and error tracking.
  - Implement autoscaling based on traffic.
- **Technologies:** Cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure), Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, ELK stack for logging.

### Project Wrap-up
- **Documentation:** Document each part of the project, including architecture diagrams and API documentation.
- **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing at each phase, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Feedback and Iteration:** Continuously refine the application based on user feedback and performance metrics.

This project will not only improve your coding skills across the full stack but also give you valuable experience in designing and managing a complex application architecture. Remember, each phase builds upon the previous, so ensure a solid foundation before moving to the next.
